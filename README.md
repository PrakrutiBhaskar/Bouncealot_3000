# 🟥 Bouncing Square Animation – p5.js Project

A simple interactive p5.js sketch where a square bounces around the screen after you click anywhere to start. Pressing any key will reset the animation.It is similar to the bouncing dvd logo.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The canvas shows a message:  
  🖱️ **"Press anywhere on the screen to start"**
- On clicking anywhere, a square appears at the mouse position and starts bouncing around the screen.
- The square reflects off the edges of the canvas.
- Press **any key** to stop the animation and return to the start screen.
